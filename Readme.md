## Key Insights
1. Gender Balance : Identified the current gender distribution across various levels of the organization.
2. Hiring Trends : Analyzed hiring patterns to assess gender balance in recruitment.
3. Promotion Rates : Examined promotion rates by gender to identify any disparities.
4. Performance Metrics: Assessed performance metrics to understand if there are any biases.
5. Turnover Rates : Analyzed turnover rates to determine if certain demographics are more likely to leave the organization.
6. Diversity Benchmarks : Compared the organization's diversity metrics with industry benchmarks.

## Dataset
The dataset includes detailed information on employee demographics and organizational metrics, covering aspects such as:
* Employee details
* Gender, age, and other demographic information
* Hiring and promotion history
* Performance ratings
* Turnover status

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** : Ensuring data quality by handling missing values and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)** : Gaining initial insights and identifying patterns in the data.
3. **KPI Development** : Creating metrics to measure diversity and inclusion in hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover.
4. **Visualization** : Using Power BI to create interactive dashboards for tracking and communicating insights.

## Tools and Technologies
* Power BI : For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
* Excel : For initial data exploration and analysis.

## Results
